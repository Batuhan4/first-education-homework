## Build Challenge

Fixed the build error in the `build` package.

The main issue was a missing dependency on the `capability` module and an incorrect type definition in the `build.move` file.

To fix this, I:
1. Added a dependency on the `capability` module in `build/Move.toml`.
2. Corrected the type of the `capability` parameter in the `init_with_capability` function in `build/sources/build.move`.
3. Fixed the `capability` module itself, which had a commented-out module declaration and an incomplete `WorkshopCapability` struct.
4. Addressed compiler warnings related to unused mutable references.

## Capability Challenge

Completed the capability challenge by implementing a simple workshop system.

- **`WorkshopCapability`**: A struct representing the permission to modify a workshop.
- **`Workshop`**: A struct that holds the workshop's lessons in a vector.
- **`create_workshop`**: An entry function to create a new `Workshop` object.
- **`add_lesson`**: An entry function that allows the holder of a `WorkshopCapability` to add a lesson to a `Workshop`.

The code was also cleaned up to remove unnecessary `use` statements, resulting in a clean build with no warnings.
