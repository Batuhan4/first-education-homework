Fixed the build error in the `build` package.

The main issue was a missing dependency on the `capability` module and an incorrect type definition in the `build.move` file.

To fix this, I:
1. Added a dependency on the `capability` module in `build/Move.toml`.
2. Corrected the type of the `capability` parameter in the `init_with_capability` function in `build/sources/build.move`.
3. Fixed the `capability` module itself, which had a commented-out module declaration and an incomplete `WorkshopCapability` struct.
4. Addressed compiler warnings related to unused mutable references.
