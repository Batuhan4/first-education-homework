This Rust example demonstrates how to use the `SuiClientBuilder` to establish connections to the Sui `testnet`, `devnet`, and `mainnet` full nodes. It then retrieves and prints the API version for each successfully connected network, showcasing a fundamental interaction with the Sui blockchain.
```rust
use sui_sdk::SuiClientBuilder;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), anyhow::Error> {
    // Sui testnet -- https://fullnode.testnet.sui.io:443
    let sui_testnet = SuiClientBuilder::default().build_testnet().await?;
    println!("Sui testnet version: {}", sui_testnet.api_version());

     // Sui devnet -- https://fullnode.devnet.sui.io:443
    let sui_devnet = SuiClientBuilder::default().build_devnet().await?;
    println!("Sui devnet version: {}", sui_devnet.api_version());

    // Sui mainnet -- https://fullnode.mainnet.sui.io:443
    let sui_mainnet = SuiClientBuilder::default().build_mainnet().await?;
    println!("Sui mainnet version: {}", sui_mainnet.api_version());

    Ok(())
}
```

## Running Sui Indexer as a Data Writer
This command executes the Sui indexer, configured to pull data from a fullnode and write it to the database. It utilizes the `mysql-feature` and allows specifying a custom RPC client URL for local development or a public fullnode, with an option to reset the database.
```sh
cargo run --bin sui-indexer --features mysql-feature --no-default-features -- --db-url "<DATABASE_URL>" --rpc-client-url "https://fullnode.devnet.sui.io:443" --fullnode-sync-worker --reset-db
```

## Start Sui Full Node using Docker Compose
This command initiates the Sui Full node services defined in the `docker-compose.yaml` file. The `-d` flag runs the services in detached mode, allowing them to run in the background.

```
```Shell
source ~/.bashrc
```
```Shell
source ~/.zshrc
```

## Sui `#[sim_test]` Macro Reference
Comprehensive documentation for the `#[sim_test]` macro, detailing its `config` and `check_determinism` arguments, their types, purpose, and usage examples for configuring simulation tests within the Sui framework.
```APIDOC
#[sim_test] macro
  - config = "config_expr":
    - Description: Specifies a configuration expression for the test.
    - Type: string (evaluated as Rust expression)
    - Returns: A type implementing `Into<TestConfig>`, commonly `SimConfig`, `Vec<SimConfig>`, or `Vec<(usize, SimConfig)>`.
    - Usage: Generally a function call returning the desired configuration.
    - Reference: `msim/src/sim/config.rs` for `TestConfig` implementation.
  - check_determinism:
    - Description: If set, runs the test twice and verifies identical execution by comparing PRNG logs.
    - Type: boolean (flag)
    - Usage: Primarily for testing the framework itself; rarely needed for typical tests.
```

## Generate Static Sui Documentation Site for Review
